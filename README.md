# Lost-and-Found
Just made this to find specific lines in large files so if you searched a email or name or any specific words it pulls everything off the line into an output file.
Works with .txt, .pdf, and .py files to help locate specific information.

git clone
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 LostandFound.py
